Description: A novel forward stepwise discriminant analysis framework 
    that integrates Pillai's trace with Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA), 
    providing an improvement over traditional stepwise LDA methods that rely on Wilks' Lambda. 
    A stand-alone ULDA implementation is also provided, offering a more general solution 
    than the one available in the 'MASS' package. It automatically handles missing values and 
    provides visualization tools. For more details, see Wang (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2409.03136>.
